# Image Segmentation using PyTorch
 Image segmentation is a critical process in computer vision. It involves dividing a visual input into segments to simplify image analysis. Segments represent objects or parts of objects, and comprise sets of pixels, or “super-pixels” . Deeplabv3-ResNet101 is contructed by a Deeplabv3 model with a ResNet-101 backbone. The pre-trained model has been trained on a subset of COCO train2017, on the 20 categories that are present in the Pascal VOC dataset.
